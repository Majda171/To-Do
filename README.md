# To-Do List Application

This is a simple web-based To-Do List application where users can add tasks, mark them as completed using checkboxes, and remove them. The application stores tasks in the browser's Local Storage, so they persist between sessions.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks using an input field.
- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed using a checkbox. Completed tasks are visually distinguished.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be deleted by clicking the "Delete" button.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in Local Storage, so they will not disappear when you refresh the page or close the browser.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For the styling, including custom-styled checkboxes.
- **JavaScript**: Handles task adding, removing, marking as complete, and storing tasks in Local Storage.
- **Local Storage**: Used to save tasks persistently in the browser.
